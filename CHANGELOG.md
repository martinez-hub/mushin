## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-22

First release of `mushin` as a standalone package — a fork of the
`rai_toolbox.mushin` workflow layer from MIT Lincoln Laboratory's
(unmaintained) responsible-ai-toolbox.

### Added
- Standalone packaging: `pyproject.toml`, MIT license (original MIT-LL copyright
  retained), README, and a vendored `value_check` so the package no longer
  depends on `rai_toolbox`.
- uv-based development workflow with a committed `uv.lock`.
- Ruff (lint + format) and codespell, with pre-commit hooks.
- `Makefile` developer shortcuts (`make check`, `make test-py`, ...).
- GitHub Actions CI across Python 3.9–3.14.
- Community health files: CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, issue forms,
  PR template, Dependabot, CODEOWNERS.

### Changed
- Modernized type hints (PEP 585 generics, `collections.abc` imports).
- Declared support for Python 3.9–3.14; NumPy >= 2 except on Intel-macOS, which
  is capped at NumPy 1.x / torch 2.2.x (no newer wheels on that platform).

### Fixed
- Compatibility with PyTorch 2.6+, which changed `torch.load`'s default
  `weights_only` to `True`: pass `weights_only=False` when loading trusted,
  self-produced metric and checkpoint files.
- `test_overrides_roundtrip`: exclude Hydra-reserved tokens (`null`/`none`/
  `nan`/`inf`) from the generated-string strategy.
- Updated deprecated `xarray.Dataset.dims` to `.sizes` in tests.
